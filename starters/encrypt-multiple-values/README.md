# Encrypt Multiple Values (Example)

This starter provides a placeholder `EncryptMultipleValues` contract that demonstrates a simple interface for storing encrypted payloads. It is intended as a starting point for FHE-related examples; adapt the storage and ABI to your encryption scheme.

Usage

- Copy the contract into your Hardhat project contracts directory.
- Run tests: `npx hardhat test --grep EncryptMultipleValues`
